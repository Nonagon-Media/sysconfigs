Various config files for tools I use

vimrc_updated:
        an vimrc file updated with additional plugins, language-specific tab/space rules, and new coloring scheme.
        xoria code has been removed, but still exists in the old vimrc file
        May require installation of various linting tools for syntastic to work properly.
        For example: jslint requires nodejs/npm installation
